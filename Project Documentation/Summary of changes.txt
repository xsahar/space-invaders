The changes made to switch from setInterval to requestAnimationFrame involve:

Replacing setInterval with requestAnimationFrame:
Functions that were previously called at regular intervals using setInterval are now called using requestAnimationFrame.

Adding timestamp checks:
Functions now include timestamp checks to determine if enough time has passed to perform the next action. This ensures that the actions are performed at the desired intervals.

Updating the game loop logic:
The game loop logic is updated to use requestAnimationFrame for smoother 
animations and better performance.

Handling pause state:

The pause state is managed within the requestAnimationFrame loops to ensure that animations and game logic are paused correctly.

Canceling and restarting animations:
cancelAnimationFrame is used to stop animations when necessary, such as when the game is paused or over. Animations are restarted using requestAnimationFrame when the game resumes.
