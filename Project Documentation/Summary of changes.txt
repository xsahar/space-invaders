The changes made to switch from setInterval to requestAnimationFrame involve:

Replacing setInterval with requestAnimationFrame:
Functions that were previously called at regular intervals using setInterval are now called using requestAnimationFrame.

Adding timestamp checks:
Functions now include timestamp checks to determine if enough time has passed to perform the next action. This ensures that the actions are performed at the desired intervals.

Updating the game loop logic:
The game loop logic is updated to use requestAnimationFrame for smoother 
animations and better performance.

Handling pause state:

The pause state is managed within the requestAnimationFrame loops to ensure that animations and game logic are paused correctly.

Canceling and restarting animations:
cancelAnimationFrame is used to stop animations when necessary, such as when the game is paused or over. Animations are restarted using requestAnimationFrame when the game resumes.

Remove the pause after the game is over cause it used to show even if the game is over and the invaders move if u click on it ("Esc or p)

Implemented is isGameOver to stop the invader from shooting and moving when the game is over


shoot and pause freezes laser even after unpausing :
Laser Movement: Modified the moveLaser and moveLaserDown functions to handle the paused state correctly and ensure they are called again after unpausing.
Invader Laser Removal: Ensured that the invader laser is properly removed in the moveLaserDown function.
Pause/Unpause Handling: Modified the togglePause function to resume laser movement after unpausing.

Check for Invader Collision with Shooter:
Add a check in the moveInvaders function to see if any invader has reached the shooter's position.
If an invader reaches the shooter's position, trigger the game over logic.
